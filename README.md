This is the repository for the Broken Calculator by the team The Three Musketeers in the developer Discord community Cascaderans. 

The Three Musketeers ended up being Two Musketeers who worked great in a team to get this challenge entry finished! :)

The challenge below:

"It is my pleasure to announce the details for the very first challenge of our Three Legged Race! Make sure you are in communication with your teammates about your desired roles for this first leg, and about coordinating your GitHub accounts. If you have any trouble with this, please let us know and weâ€™ll help you out! I recommend that the player in charge of HTML act as the project manager for each leg. The project manager will make the initial repo, and each member should be careful to only add their own language to the project.

Another quick note: the final project should be hosted to be viewable as a website as well as a repo. GitHub Pages is a pretty straightforward option for hosting. Let us know if you need help getting that set up as well.

Okay, without further ado: The First Challenge!

The First Challenge is to make a Broken Calculator! 

This is a twist on the normal calculator app, in that your calculator is required to â€˜malfunctionâ€™ in some way.  It could be that each time you press a button it gets stuck and canâ€™t be pressed a second time, or that all answers are 1 more than the correct answer, or maybe the whole machine turns into a demonic monster after you press too many buttons. The possibilities are endless, and the great part is that if you mess up you can say itâ€™s intentional ðŸ¤£ â€”But do try to make the intended misbehavior explicit, with some type of introduction so that a person viewing the site without a heads up will understand that yes, it is broken on purpose.

The voting for the best entry will take place next Sunday, and the the next contest will start on Monday. But if youâ€™re still working on it at that time, no worries! You can keep working on it at your own pace, or put it on hold to do the second challenge, whichever your team decides.


Please let me know if you have any questions that your teammates canâ€™t help you withâ€” and happy coding!"
